## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a programmer and photographer with a deep passion for the natural world and the **"Do It Yourself"** culture. I believe in the power of shared knowledge, which is why I release my software, media, and research data freely to the community.

* **Open Solutions:** I develop open applications, tools, and media (photos, videos, sounds).
* **Education & FLOSS:** I advocate for free culture by conducting pro-bono lectures at universities and in the private sector, teaching how to effectively use **free licenses and FLOSS tools**.
* **Volunteer Work:** I frequently offer my photography skills as a volunteer for **NGOs** and non-profit initiatives.

## 🎥 Educational Content & Community
I love sharing what I know. You can find me on various platforms promoting open-source tools and nature awareness:

* **YouTube:** I create tutorials focused on **graphic design software** and document my DIY technical journeys. Check it out at [YouTube @KrzysiuNet](https://www.youtube.com/@KrzysiuNet).
* **Nature in the City:** I run the project **"Między drogą a garażem"**, a platform dedicated to popularizing knowledge about urban nature and local biodiversity. So far it's Polish-only, but at least you can be sure, the content is quite polished! And auto-transation does wonders. Follow it on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/miedzy.droga.a.garazem/).

## 🔬 Citizen Science & Macrophotography
My focus is on insect macrophotography and entomological research. 
* **iNaturalist:** I contribute high-quality photos and observations to support global biodiversity databases and researchers.
* **Recognition:** My visual work has been featured in mainstream media, official publications, and recognized in several competitions.
